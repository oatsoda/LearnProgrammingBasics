# LearnProgrammingBasics
Introductory Tutorials to teach programming to children.  These aren't intended to necceessarily teach syntax and coding as such, more just a general introduction to familiarise and hopefully inspire!

These are best as walkthroughs to do with them rather than expecting them to complete them on their own.

Each "Module" has an Example to explain and then execute to demonstrate, followed by a Challenge/Walkthrough to complete.

1. Input output console colours
2. Variables
3. While loop For input
4. What is True/False - logical statements and how they resolve
5. Functions and how they work. e.g. Math functions, Random
6. Conditional logic - if
