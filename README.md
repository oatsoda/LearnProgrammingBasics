# LearnProgrammingBasics
Introductory Tutorials to teach programming to children.  These aren't intended to necceessarily teach syntax and coding as such, more just a general introduction to familiarise and hopefully inspire!

Each "Module" has an Example to explain which you should walkthrough and run the program.

There are also Activity modules which are intended to be walkthroughs which you actually write the code as you go (with their help perhaps).

Intro

Explain that this kind of programming is a basic Console App - Their parents probably remember using computers where you had to type commands rather than using a cursor and a mouse.

1. Input output console colours
2. While loop For input
3. Functions and how they work. e.g. Math functions, Random
4. Activity: Write a program that outputs what was input 3 times in different colours and exits when the user inputs the letter X.
5. Conditional logic - if
6. Types - string (text) or integer (number)
7. Activity: Guess the number between 1 and 10
8. Basic For Loops
9. Some kind of game / visual! - Putting it all together
10. What is True/False - logical statements and how they resolve
